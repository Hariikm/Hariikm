<h1>Harikrishnan M - AI & ML Enthusiast</h1>

Hello! I'm Hari, an AI and ML enthusiast. ðŸ¤“

As a fresher, I am currently immersed in learning data science, focusing specifically on machine learning and data analytics tools such as Excel, SQL, PowerBI, and Tableau. To enhance my skills and broaden my understanding of these domains, I am actively involved in multiple projects that you can explore in my repositories.

With a background in physics, my passion for statistics and applied mathematics has been nurtured since early on. I began my journey by tutoring physics and successfully managed an online tuition center with over 30 students and 4 teachers. This experience highlighted the significance of data collection and analysis, which kindled my interest in the stock market. As a result, my fascination with data and its diverse applications deepened even further.

I am filled with enthusiasm when it comes to exploring the field of AI and ML. I am constantly learning and adapting to the latest advancements, eager to embrace the endless possibilities they offer. My goal is to contribute my skills and knowledge to this dynamic domain, and I am excited to be part of its transformative impact.
